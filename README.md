# Material3-Lottie-Expressive-Demo

This project is a showcase of using **Material 3 expressive UI components** and **Lottie animations** in a Jetpack Compose Android application. It includes interactive and animated UI examples to help understand how to implement and customize modern UI elements effectively.

---

## 🌟 Key Features

* 🎞️ **Lottie Animation** support using `lottie-compose`
* 🎨 Change **individual component colors** in Lottie using dynamic properties
* 🌀 Integration of **Material 3 Expressive Components**:

  * `CircularProgressIndicator`
  * `CircularWavyProgressIndicator`
  * `ContainedLoadingIndicator`
  * `VerticalSlider`
  * `Pull-to-Refresh` (using Accompanist SwipeRefresh)
* 🎯 Smooth animations, theme-aware design, and user interaction

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This project was built to:

* Practice the use of Lottie animations in Jetpack Compose
* Understand how to **dynamically modify Lottie layers** such as changing colors
* Experiment with **Material 3 expressive UI elements**
* Learn how to implement **pull-to-refresh animations** in Compose
* Explore building **fluid, reactive UIs** in a declarative style

---

## 📚 Concepts Practiced

* Jetpack Compose fundamentals
* Material 3 theming and components
* Animation principles using Lottie
* Dynamic customization of Lottie via key paths and properties
* Swipe-to-refresh gesture handling with smooth indicators
* Kotlin state handling and recomposition for animation updates

## 🧩 Material 3 Expressive Components Used

| Component                       | Description                                                             |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CircularProgressIndicator`     | A standard circular loading spinner with customizable progress and size |
| `CircularWavyProgressIndicator` | A wavy animated circular loader offering a more expressive alternative  |
| `ContainedLoadingIndicator`     | A button-like indicator with a built-in loader                          |
| `VerticalSlider`                | A vertical slider for value selection with steps and ranges             |
| `SwipeRefresh`                  | Pull-to-refresh component integrated with any scrolling content         |
